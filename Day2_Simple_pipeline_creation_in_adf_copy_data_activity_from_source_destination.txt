Topic 3) Creation of Your First Azure Data Factory 

Prerequisite: Azure Subscription and Azure Storage account

	â€¢ Requirement : to copy the file from one folder to another folder in the same storage account using Copy data activity in Azure Data Factory 

Step1) To create a storage account and create a container named adfdemo and inside that container create a input folder having file name data.txt

Now we will create an input container holding our data

Step2) create ADF and inside that create linked service for storage account 
And create two data set one for source loaction of data and one for destination location where we want to copy our data 


Step 3) Now we will create a pipeline where we will configure the copy data activity with the source and destination dataset that we have created


Step 4) Now we can test our pipeline by clicking on the debug button and once that is succesful run of the pipeline then publish all the changes like linked service,datasets and the pipeline itself
